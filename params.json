{"name":"Moonmod","body":"The Amazing Moonmod \r\n===================\r\n\r\nThere is alot that needs to be done, but here is the pre release\r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n===================\r\n\r\nThe Modding Team\r\n\r\nJlndk - The Owner and coder\r\n\r\nHow to get there\r\nTo get to The Moon you have to build a portal. The portal looks same as Nether portal, but is made from cheese, because as you Moon is made from cheese, isn’t it? To activate the portal use Sonic Screwdiver. As you find out later the cheese myth isn’t really true, but every there is a little bit of truth in every tale.\r\n\r\nLiving on The Moon\r\nOn Moon there are few changes against Minecraftia. As you know, Moon doesn’t have an atmosphere. So you have to wear super-duper Moon Suit or you will suffocate in no time. Also because of absence of atmosphere you cannot place certain blocks including plants, fluids and fire operating crafts (furnaces, torches). If you want to smelt ores or use torches. No problem. Just take a piece of Minecraftia with you. It’s really easy, just craft a Moon Tent for you. Tent unites a protection and portability. You want to move on? Just pack your tent and head to adventure.\r\n\r\nThe Moon has a lower gravity than Minecraftia. So you can jump higher and fall deeper at ease. But this could be a little contra productive. So if you want to jump a little use duck jump i.e.  jump while sneaking.\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n-Updated to 1.4.6\r\n-added Cheese slice (put a cheese block into crafting table to create 4 slices. each of them generates 4 hp)\r\n- fixed textures\r\nFAQ\r\n\r\nQ: How do I build the portal?\r\nA: First create a vertical frame 4 by 5 from cheese. Then right click to activate it with Sonic Screwdriver.\r\n\r\nQ: How do I build a tent? It says \"Couldnt build a tent.\" What should I do?\r\nA: Well placing a tent is a bit tricky. First you have to make sure you have a flat area 8 by 8 block. Above these platform there have to be at least 4 block of free space (air). Then dig a hole in the middle of this platform and fill it with tent block. This flat platform will be repalced with tent floor.\r\n\r\nQ: When I step into portal, I get message about entering the Nehter or the screen freezes with message \"Saving Chunks\". What should I do?\r\nA: Currently there is some problems with traveling through portal. It seems that The Moon isn't currently compatible with Creative mode. just change gamemode and then should everything be allright.\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\nIf someone got a solution plz reply\r\n- You cant travel to the moon in creative mode\r\n- moon tent dont work\r\n- u can breath without moonsuit equipped on the moon\r\n- gravity is equal to the normal\r\n- lakes and overworld stuff generates on the moon and reverse\r\n\r\nTODO list:\r\nfix creative mode issue/bug\r\nFix atmosphere and air\r\nFix gravity\r\nFix Moonsuit\r\nFix Moontent\r\nAdd a mob\r\nMaybe some of your ideas \r\n\r\n\r\nDownload: \r\n\r\n[size=5]Installation Instructions:\r\n[size=4]1.
