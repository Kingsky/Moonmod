<h2>How to get there</h2>
<p>To get to The Moon you have to build a portal. The portal looks same as Nether portal, but is made from cheese, because as you Moon is made from cheese, isn’t it? To activate the portal use Sonic Screwdiver. As you find out later the cheese myth isn’t really true, but every there is a little bit of truth in every tale.</p>

<p>Living on The Moon
On Moon there are few changes against Minecraftia. As you know, Moon doesn’t have an atmosphere. So you have to wear super-duper Moon Suit or you will suffocate in no time. Also because of absence of atmosphere you cannot place certain blocks including plants, fluids and fire operating crafts (furnaces, torches). If you want to smelt ores or use torches. No problem. Just take a piece of Minecraftia with you. It’s really easy, just craft a Moon Tent for you. Tent unites a protection and portability. You want to move on? Just pack your tent and head to adventure.</p>

<p>The Moon has a lower gravity than Minecraftia. So you can jump higher and fall deeper at ease. But this could be a little contra productive. So if you want to jump a little use duck jump i.e.  jump while sneaking.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2></li>
</ul><p>Q: How do I build the portal?</p>
<p>A: First create a vertical frame 4 by 5 from cheese. Then right click to activate it with Sonic Screwdriver.</p>

<p>Q: How do I build a tent? It says "Couldnt build a tent." What should I do?
A: Well placing a tent is a bit tricky. It dont works right now but normally, you have to make sure you have a flat area 8 by 8 block. Above these platform there have to be at least 4 block of free space (air). Then dig a hole in the middle of this platform and fill it with tent block. This flat platform will be repalced with tent floor.

<h4>Reinforced Cloth</h4>
<p>
Top Minecraft scientist copied this technology directly from NASA, so it has to work, sure? It’s like the ordinary cloth but it’s reinforced with golden coating, which provides airtightness and blocks cosmic rays.

<h4>Moon Tent</h4>
<p>
Your very own piece of homeland in vast nothingness of Moon. To build one you will need a Tent Block, Sonic Screwdriver and flat solid area. First dig out one block and replace it with Tent Block, then right click while holding charged Sonic Screwdriver and voila you have your Moon Tent ready. Inside the tent same rules as on the surface apply. You don’t have to wear Moon Suit. You can place all blocks (except Bed) use torches and so on. If you want to move on, simply click the Tent Block again and Moon Tent will pack into small carry able package.

<h4>Moon Lamp</h4>
<p>
On Moon it’s kinda dark, but ordinary torches don’t work here. Problem? Not really, just use these Moon Lamps!

<h4>Moon Suit</h4>
<p>
This piece of clothing is the most important part of your wardrobe. It protects you on surface of the moon. It provides same protection as leather armour so take care of it, but it grants you ability to breath in vacuum on Moon surface.

<h5>Moon Helmet</h5>

<h5>Moon Boots</h5>

<h4>Sonic Screwdriver</h4>
<p>
This is the most important tool for Moon explorer. It has 30 uses before it turns off. To make it operative again you have to recharge it. Note: You can only recharge a fully depleted screwdriver.

<h2> how to join the project</h2>

Register on Github
To do anything useful I first needed to sign up for an account. Github has a range of accounts but I found that with one of their free accounts I would be able to get started and contribute to the project. This gives me a project space of my own and a user to tie all my activities to.

Set up SSH Key
In order to authenticate against the github servers, you need to set up an ssh key and give them your public key so they know you are you. You'll then need to tell git to use this key whenever it makes contact with the github servers. I do quite a bit with ssh and ssh keys myself so I was comfortable with this step. Even if you are totally new, its still pretty straightforward and they have a great howto on github itself which will help.

I had issues with git not picking up that it needed to use a non-standard ssh key, but I found the answers in this entry on the git website. In a nutshell, set up an ssh alias, set the key in there and then use the alias instead of the actual URL when giving the repo location to git. This now works like a charm for me.

Fork the Project
Now, github uses "fork" where I might choose to say "checkout" - fork in my world means something else completely. But in this case you're just making your own copy of the project repository. This is where you will commit your changes to and it retains its link with the original repository making it easy for anyone with commit access to that to pull in your changes. Patch files are nowhere to be seen, and although I was wary at first, this is project collaboration at its most painless, I'm impressed! Forking was relatively simple and again there was great documentation on the github site. In particular I recommend that you take the time to follow the bit about adding an alias for the "upstream" repository - this made committing my changes to the main joind.in repo really easy.

The forking instructions linked above also gave a description of how to actually use git, how to get my changes applied to my local repo, and how to push them to my remote repo on github itself.

Make a Pull Request
Once I'd fixed a few things, I was ready to push the code back to the main project so that Chris could consider it for inclusion. This is done by making a pull request from the main project page - you can add a comment about the changes you are supplying to help the maintainers to manage all the incoming patches.

Go Forth and Contribute
It was easier than I expected to get set up to contribute to a project using github, so find something you want to improve and/or be involved with, and do it. I began by fixing the docs for joind.in, which was a great place to start since it allowed me to make a useful contribution without touching the code in the first instance :)
